                <div class="textbox">
                <p class="paragraph">Stated by David Robson at the BBC and supported by the Harvard Carr Center for Human Rights Policy,
                    "Nonviolent protests are twice as likely to succeed as armed conflicts, and those engaging a threshold of 3.5% of the population have never failed to bring about change."
                    It takes just 3.5% of the population's refusal to accept human rights violations to bring about permenant change.
                     You might be saying to yourself
                     "Only 3.5%? Thats all it takes?" That sure sounds like an attainable goal, and I 
                     certainly agree, but 3.5% of the population is still 11.7 million people!
                     11.7 million people participating in active action is quiet the feat and it will not 
                     happen without your help. That is why I am asking America to join us, the 3.5%, to stand
                     with our marginalized brothers and sisters for change.

                <div class="textbox">
                <p class="paragraph"> First, keep an eye on this website. We will soon be adding a mailing list to sign up for our newsletter.<br><br>  
                    Next, take time to educate yourself on the civil rights movements that have come before us and that we hope to build upon. We will be compiling a reading list to this end.<br><br>
                    Then you take action by getting involved in your local community. The goal of the 3.5% is to support communities throughout
                    the United States through mutual aid intiatives and community support networks. We will
                    keep a living list of organizations that you can get involved in or donate to. The 
                    3.5% will also be looking to collect donations from supporters in the future in an effort to fund local organizations 
                    that closely align with our mission.
